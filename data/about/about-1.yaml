description: Inspired in 2012 from the loss of valued friends due to gang affiliation and crime, Stephen Addison launched the project ‘Box Up Crime’ in 2013, a new initiative which provides social change though social innovation. We use sports, in particular boxing, as a tool to inspire, educate and develop young individuals, specifically those who have been involved in crime.<br/><br/>This will be used as a foundation to continually create awareness and confidence building with communities. We strive to develop strong relationships with secondary schools within the borough, promising to provide assistance to improve students' behaviour.
