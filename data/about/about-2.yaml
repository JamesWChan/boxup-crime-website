description: BoxUp Crime began as an idea for a university dissertation. Stephen's vision impressed his lecturers and he was offered Â£1200 to start the social enterprise in 2012. 2012 proved difficult, however, and BoxUp Crime was dissolved and refounded several times.<br/><br/>In 2013, Stephen was nominated for the Mayor of London awards for his work and a picture of Stephen and Boris Johnson went viral. Subsequently, public awareness of BoxUp Crime increased dramatically and we're now going from strength to strength. Our HQ is in London however we have a hub in Switzerland and plans to establish ourselves in Ghana and the USA in the near future. We've reached thousands of young people from disadvantaged and troubled backgrounds to reclaim their dreams and lead fulfilling lives. We're excited; and we hope you are too.
