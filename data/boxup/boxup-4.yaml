subtitle: Inspiring all young people aged between 4 - 24 years
description: Our community sessions are described as a fun place to be for young people aged 4-24. We believe in early intervention as well as long term intervention, thatâ€™s why we work so closely with this specific age group. We deliver non contact boxing sessions alongside with mentoring and career support to local young residents in the community. We have a vision to scale these free community sessions nationally, allowing us to reach more young people who will benefit from it. For now, we run sessions at the following two locations and welcome all those who meet the age criteria.
