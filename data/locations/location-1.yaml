description: BoxUp Crime currently operates out of Barking and Dagenham. We are eager to expand our presence throughout London, and we are actively working to set up new branches of the organisation in five new boroughs. By seeking out similar local figures with an intimite knowledge of the youth and gang dynamics in each borough, Box Up will create a wider reaching program that interconnects around the city, and tackles the growing epidemic of teenage murders.
